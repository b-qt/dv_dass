# DASS

This project concerns analysis of data pertaining to Answers to the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale using data from [https://openpsychometrics.org](https://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/) responses of 2018.

## Project Intro/Objective

The purpose of this project is to gain and provide more insights to silent killers like Depression, Anxiety and Stress. __Silent killers__ in this context refer to diseases with no obvious symptomps or indications.
Representing this data in a way which is more engaging is important to those affected and those susceptible so they know how to identify, deal with their situations and when to throw in the towel to ask for help.

### Methods Used

* Inferential Statistics
* Data Exploration and Manipulation
* Data Analysis
* Data Modelling
* Data Visualization

### Technologies

* Python
* VSCode
* Pandas, jupyter
* HTML
* Procreate

## Project Description

Working with [open data](https://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/) under “Answers to the Depression Anxiety Stress scales”, the goal is to provide an overview of DASS (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale) scores and other significant variables present in the data according to informative demographics.
Country and age are important demographics because countries differ in how children are brought up and the types of freedom they are given, which in turn affects how they tend to perceive themselves.

_What would I like to know?_

* What demographics influence these diseases? I'm assuming location and upbringing play a major role in childrens psychological health. But what other demographics play roles and to what extent?

_Progress Report_.

- [X] Download the data.
- [X] Overview of the data.
- [ ] Separate into Depression, Anxiety and Stress
- [ ] Calculate percentages of distributions
- [ ] Visualize each of these separately
- [ ] Look for obvious relationships.
- [ ] Calculate covariance and correlation of variables.
- [ ] Discard unnecessary variables.
- [ ] Select a tool for visualization.
- [ ] Publish visualization.

_Goal_
With this project I’ll like to showcase data storytelling as a skill hoping to make more people aware of these “silent killers”.
